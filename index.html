# Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring with RF-Based Biosensor

## Overview

This project focuses on a non-invasive method for measuring blood glucose concentration using an RF-based biosensor. The biosensor design features Octagonal Shaped Complementary Split Ring Resonators (OSCSRR) on a Rogers RO4003C substrate, allowing for painless and continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels.

## Introduction

Diabetes is a prevalent health condition that requires frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels. Traditional methods involve invasive procedures like blood pricking, which can be uncomfortable and inconvenient. This project seeks to provide an alternative solution using an RF-based biosensor.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop an RF-based biosensor capable of measuring blood glucose concentration non-invasively. The key goals include:

- Fabricating the biosensor with OSCSRRs on a Rogers RO4003C substrate.
- Calibrating the sensor for accurate glucose concentration measurements.
- Conducting experiments to validate the biosensor's performance.
- Analyzing data and establishing correlations between S-Parameter values and blood glucose levels.

## Methodology

### Biosensor Fabrication

1. **Design**: The biosensor is designed with four cells of Octagonal Shaped Complementary Split Ring Resonators (OSCSRR) on a Rogers RO4003C substrate.

2. **Calibration**: The sensor is calibrated to establish a baseline for accurate glucose concentration measurements.

### Testing

3. **Glucose Concentration Experiments**: The biosensor is tested with blood samples containing varying glucose concentrations, ranging from 0 to 300mg/dl, as per the Cole-Cole model.

4. **Data Analysis**: Collected data is analyzed to create a model for correlating S-Parameter values with blood glucose levels.

## Setup

Describe the hardware and software setup required to use the RF-based biosensor for blood glucose monitoring.
