# Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Using an RF-Based Biosensor

Diabetes is a prevalent health issue faced by many people today, primarily caused by an increase in blood sugar levels. Insulin secretion by the pancreas plays a crucial role in controlling blood sugar levels, and diabetes is classified into two main types: type 1 and type 2, depending on insulin secretion. Type 2 diabetes is more common in the present day.

Traditional methods of measuring blood glucose levels involved glucometers and blood tests, which required invasive blood pricking. While minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices have improved the lives of diabetic patients to some extent, they still have certain limitations, such as painful insertion, high cost, and discomfort. Consequently, non-invasive glucose monitoring has been an active area of research for the past two decades, and various techniques have been proposed.

This study proposes a non-invasive method of measuring blood glucose concentration using an RF-based biosensor. The sensor design consists of four cells of Octagonal Shaped Complementary Split Ring Resonator (OSCSRR) on a Rogers RO4003C substrate. The main concept involves placing a finger on the sensing elements and observing the Reflection-Coefficient S11 S-Parameter with magnitude concentration for the blood layer with different glucose concentrations of type 2 diabetes, ranging from 0 to 300mg/dl, as presented by the Cole-Cole model.

## Proposed Sensor Design

The RF-based biosensor comprises four cells of Octagonal Shaped Complementary Split Ring Resonator (OSCSRR) on a Rogers RO4003C substrate. The design is optimized to provide accurate measurements of blood glucose concentration.

## Research Objective

The primary objective of this research is to develop a non-invasive method of measuring blood glucose levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes. By observing the Reflection-Coefficient S11 S-Parameter with magnitude concentration using the proposed sensor design, we aim to establish a correlation between the RF signal characteristics and blood glucose concentrations as per the Cole-Cole model.

## Methodology

1. Fabrication of the RF-based biosensor with four cells of OSCSRR on a Rogers RO4003C substrate.
2. Calibration of the biosensor with known glucose concentrations.
3. Experimentation with individuals having type 2 diabetes by placing their finger on the sensor.
4. Collecting data on the Reflection-Coefficient S11 S-Parameter with magnitude concentration for different glucose concentrations ranging from 0 to 300mg/dl.
5. Analyzing the collected data to establish a relationship between RF signal characteristics and blood glucose concentrations.

## Expected Benefits

The proposed non-invasive blood glucose monitoring method offers several potential benefits:

- Elimination of painful blood pricking, making it more comfortable for diabetic patients.
- Reduced costs compared to traditional glucose monitoring devices.
- Continuous glucose monitoring without the need for frequent invasive procedures.
- Improved overall management of type 2 diabetes through real-time glucose level tracking.

This research represents a significant advancement in non-invasive glucose monitoring and has the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for individuals with type 2 diabetes.
